        "# **Python Basics Questions**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "  - Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "  - An interpreter executes Python code line-by-line, converting it into machine-readable instructions.\n",
        "Python uses an interpreter (like CPython) instead of a compiler, which makes debugging easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "  - Keywords are reserved words in Python that have predefined meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names).\n",
        "Example: if, for, while, True, None, def.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "  - No, keywords are reserved for special purposes in the language.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "  - Mutability means whether the content of an object can be changed after creation.\n",
        "  - Mutable → Can be changed (e.g., lists, dictionaries)\n",
        "  - Immutable → Cannot be changed (e.g., strings, tuples)\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "  - Lists store elements in dynamic memory, allowing modification.\n",
        "  - Tuples store elements in a fixed memory layout for faster access and safety, making them unchangeable.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is difference between == and is operators in Python?\n",
        "  - == → Compares values of two objects.\n",
        "  - is → Compares memory addresses (checks if both variables refer to the exact same object).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "  - Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:\n",
        "  - and → True if both conditions are true\n",
        "  - or → True if at least one condition is true\n",
        "  - not → Reverses the logical state\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "  - Type casting is converting one data type into another.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "  - Implicit (Type Conversion) → Done automatically by Python (e.g., int + float → float)\n",
        "  - Explicit (Type Casting) → Done manually using functions like int(), float(), str().\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "  - They allow decision-making in programs by executing different code blocks depending on conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "  - elif means else if — used to check multiple conditions in sequence.Only the first true condition’s block runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "  - for loop → Runs a fixed number of times (good for sequences)\n",
        "  - while loop → Runs until a condition becomes false (good for unknown repetitions)\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Dexcribe a scenario where while loop is more suitable?\n",
        "  - When you don’t know beforehand how many times to run the loop — e.g., reading user input until they type \"exit\".\n",
        "\n",
